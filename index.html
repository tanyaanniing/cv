    <p>My name is Yan Ning. I am a Year 3 Economics student specialising in Monetary and Financial Economics as well as Applied and Policy Economics.</p>
    <p>I seek to understand people, their emotions, and their motivations - especially in the context of Economics and Policymaking. My investigative and curious nature drives me to use data to inform perspectives and decisions and to explore new information. I tend to go beyond the surface, diving into the deeper details and investigating how a system or process works at its core. This has allowed me to find the best ways to navigate them.</p>
    <p>My working style is methodical, detail-oriented and structured. I also enjoy changing and fast-paced environments which means I love partaking in the new and untested! As I enjoy discovering new insights, I am always eager to explore internship opportunities and all the different possible career pathways.</p>
    <p>Besides my academic responsibilities, I am also a varsity athlete and President of NUS Judo (AY21/22). Judo is the first competitive sport I picked up and I loved it immediately. I have represented the school multiple times at inter-tertiary competitions and was awarded Champion of the Women -57kg category (Novice) in the Inter-Tertiary Judo Championships 2022. As I enjoy picking up new skills, I am also exploring other interests such as contemporary dance, film photography and data analytics.</p>
    <p>I hope to be able to make a tiny (<strong>but significant!</strong>) impact on someone's life.</p>
    <p>Happy to connect!</p>
